        <h2>Step 1: Prepare for the Installfest</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="installStep">You must bring</li>
        </ul>
          Your laptop. You need to have a working wifi connection, a browser and an email account you can readily access.
          If you have a choice between a Mac and a Windows laptop, please bring the Mac.
          Linux is an acceptable alternative, but the Installfest is only tested on Ubuntu.
          Power cord for your laptop
          If you already have an account on GitHub or Slack, make sure you know your username and password.

        <h2>Step 2: Don't Panic</h2>
        Even if you get stuck, please go through the rest of the instructions and download all the things you'll need. Bandwidth will be at a premium during the workshop, so it will help immensely to have everything on your laptop already.
        
        There are a lot of steps, and the instructions may seem like they're in a foreign language, but: don't panic! By the end of the workshop, you'll know what everything is and how to use it.
        

        <ul>
          <li class="installStep">do the thing</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Step 3: Read This Overview</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="installStep">do the thing</li>
      </ul>
      Here's a list of tools you'll be installing. As you go through the workshop, we'll explain what each one is for and how to use it.
      
      Google Chrome. A web browser with strong developer tools.
      Slack. A communication tool for teams.
      Git. A revision or source control system. It creates a repository, which is a complete history of your programming changes, so you can undo changes and roll back to previous versions of your work if something has gone wrong.
      GitHub.
      Xcode. To write our app, we'll need to use the Xcode IDE.
      If you've already installed the above tools and are confident they are setup correctly, make sure you are a member of the Denver-Railsbridge slack channel. Then, skip ahead to the Create a Webpage step.
